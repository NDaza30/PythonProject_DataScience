### Stock and Revenue Data Visualization
This project demonstrates the power of data visualization using Plotly and Pandas, focusing on Tesla's historical stock prices and revenue data. The goal is to provide insights into how Tesla's stock price correlates with its revenue performance over time.

####Features:
Historical Stock Prices: Visualize Tesla's share price over time, providing a clear picture of its stock performance.
Revenue Tracking: Graph Tesla's revenue on a monthly basis, showing growth or fluctuation over the selected period.
Interactive Visualizations: The charts are interactive, allowing for easy exploration of the data across different time periods.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: The data is preprocessed to remove special characters (e.g., dollar signs and commas) and ensure the proper format for analysis and visualization.

####Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas for data manipulation)
Plotly (for creating interactive graphs)
Jupyter Notebooks (for development and data exploration)
